🌦️ Weather Dashboard (React)

A modern and responsive Weather Dashboard built with React that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather information. The application fetches live data from a weather API and displays current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and a multi-day forecast.

The project demonstrates core React concepts such as functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect), API integration, and conditional rendering. It is fully responsive and optimized for a smooth user experience across devices.
